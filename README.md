A batchscript that was mainly made at ICT for school use. It is used to format a disc, put some files in it, put in a new disc, and loop it over and over. #vote for no manual booring work at ICT


This script has NO WARRANTY! If you lose some files by using this script there is a possibility that you CANNOT recover them.

This script is also written in Norwegian (translators, be my guest), so if you do not speak norwegian, i'd preffer not to use it.

Well, that was the nonsense.

install.bat installs the batch script so you can use it in your computer. I will not recomend its use outside this folder due to paths, and me not figuring it all out (yet).
You are welcome to edit and collaborate with your edits.

The use is primarly for automaticly formating a USB flash drive, and putting some files in it, meant to be faster than the slow old way of draging and the use of mouse.

--Tutorial --

1. Put files you wanna transfer in files.
2. Use formatandcopy.bat file to start.
3. Chose if you wanna read help lines (this document).
4. Select disk number.
5. Repeat? Yes or no.

Install file are not working yet.

PS: Disc number two is the favourite of the tool because of the volume and dismount possibility!
