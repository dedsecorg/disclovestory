This script has NO WARRANTY! If you lose some files by using this script there is a possibility that you CANNOT recover them.

This script is also written in Norwegian (translators, be my guest), so if you do not speak norwegian, i'd preffer not to use it.

Well, that was the nonsense.

install.bat installs the batch script so you can use it in your computer. I will not recomend its use outside this folder due to paths, and me not figuring it all out (yet).
You are welcome to edit and collaborate with your edits.

The use is primarly for automaticly formating a USB flash drive, and putting some files in it, meant to be faster than the slow old way of draging and the use of mouse.

Because of partially lazyness, i have not made it to dismount every disk you put in.. only one.. okey, sorry. But what so? If you drag it out, well, you partially 
fucked up ONE disc, AND you only have to do the process again. No problem, problem solved! But also, this is because of volumes, and when you get over one volume, well, there can be a problem if you have multiple volumes in multiple disks.. So this is for not fucking that up also.
